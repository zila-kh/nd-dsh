# Beta release gate — checklist and current standing

> Updated: 2026-09-28 · Last fully attested baseline: `feat/token-tool-routing` (`8ad0782`) on 2026-09-26 (`pnpm typecheck` clean; **855 passed / 8 skipped** unit tests). The current beta-hardening branch adds new gates/tests that are **implemented but not yet locally attested**; the local-PC handoff in [beta-three-layer-validation.md](../qa/beta-three-layer-validation.md) must produce fresh RC evidence before any GO.
>
> 2026-09-28: the hardening branch is synced with `main` (`1cc7939`, includes the workspace-profile and native-extension slices). Local gates on the merged tree: `pnpm verify` PASS, `pnpm typecheck` PASS, `pnpm test` **968 passed / 1 known CRLF environmental failure / 8 skipped**, `pnpm build` PASS. Rows 21–24 cover the surfaces merged from `main`; the RC-level evidence (automated runner, clean machine, Chrome companion, 24 h soak, Human drills) is still owed.
>
> Purpose: the pass/fail definition for **Beta Stable** — what must be predictable and recoverable before inviting users. Companion documents: [beta-release-readiness.md](beta-release-readiness.md) (ordered work plan to close the gaps), [roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) (gate definitions per release label), [../qa/README.md](../qa/README.md) (evidence index).

> Rule of the gate: don't require every planned feature to be finished — require every **beta-exposed feature** to be predictable and recoverable.

## Beta Stable criteria

Beta Stable is declared when, on the release candidate build:

1. **0 P0** — crash, data loss, security leak, wrong-company/project execution.
2. **0 known P1** in the core workflow — create project → agent work → review → git/result.
3. **Every beta-exposed feature passes all three layers: Unit + E2E + Human.**
4. **≥95% repeated scenario pass rate** on the main beta scenarios. A 99% target may be configured for a larger repeated-run sample; do not present it as a literal probability that the product is bug-free.
5. The exact packaged artifact passes the release journey, not only the source checkout.
6. Non-core incomplete features stay **Beta/Experimental behind a feature flag**.

## Three-layer release rule

The release gate now uses three independent validation layers:

- **Layer 1 — Unit:** deterministic rules, isolation, safety, recovery and failure-handling behavior.
- **Layer 2 — E2E:** the real Electron/Rust/provider/Git/browser integration, including packaged-app journeys.
- **Layer 3 — Human:** a real tester checks usability, state truthfulness, recovery, desktop behavior and failures that automation can miss.

No beta-exposed feature can be declared ready by only one or two layers. Human evidence must include the tester and date; an agent must not fabricate the Human PASS.

The machine-readable evidence template is [beta-three-layer-evidence.example.json](../qa/beta-three-layer-evidence.example.json), the operator handoff is [beta-three-layer-validation.md](../qa/beta-three-layer-validation.md), and the local gate is:

```sh
corepack pnpm beta:gate -- docs/qa/beta-three-layer-evidence-<rc>.json
```

## Checklist legend

- **Automated** — regression-tested in this tree; a green local run is standing evidence.
- **Partial** — automated coverage exists; a named gap remains.
- **Manual** — no automation; requires a real-machine/human run before the gate.

## Gate checklist

| # | Gate item | Status | Evidence in tree | Open gap |
|---|-----------|--------|------------------|----------|
| 1 | Fresh install / upgrade | Partial | `tests/app-paths.test.ts`, `tests/dsh-package-update.test.ts` (install/repair/upgrade, orphan cleanup, manifest rewrite), `tests/harness-runtime-setup.test.ts`, `scripts/stage-release.mjs` + `scripts/verify-release.mjs` + `scripts/packaged-runtime-smoke.mjs` | No config-schema migration tests across app versions; runner-based release validation blocked ([blocked-0004](../tasks/blocked-0004-windows-release-validation.md)) |
| 2 | App startup / sidecar lifecycle | Automated + Human interruption drill | `tests/harness-startup-lifecycle.test.ts`, `tests/agent-browser-shutdown.test.ts`, `tests/core-client-restart-policy.test.ts` (exactly one bounded restart; fail closed when budget is exhausted; 30 s stable reset), `crates/nd-runtime/src/windows_job.rs`, `benchmarks/windows-core-crash-cleanup.mjs`, `benchmarks/app-startup.mjs`, `tests/execution-coordinator.test.ts` | Run the packaged mid-task nd-core interruption/recovery drill on the exact RC and judge user-visible recovery |
| 3 | Core agent flow (company → project → task → agent/model → execute → result) | Automated | `tests/organization-orchestrator.test.ts` (PM→worker→review autopilot, rework cap, cancellation), `tests/organization-store.test.ts`, `tests/capability-assignment-store.test.ts`, `tests/coding-engine-routing.test.ts`, `tests/engine-session-router.test.ts`, `tests/beta-reliability.test.ts`, e2e `qa-functional.spec.ts` full work loop, `e2e:prod:user` 19/19 real-user journey | Repeatability (rate ≥95%) is a soak/day-scale property — item 17 |
| 4 | Workflow definitions / templates | Internal for Private Beta | Default/internal workflow behavior is covered by `tests/organization-workflow.test.ts`, `workflow-plugin-store.test.ts`, `workflow-plugin-manifest.test.ts`, `workflow-service.test.ts`, and `workflow-board.test.ts`. Code search confirms `workflow.create` is not exposed as a renderer create/edit-template surface in the current product UI. | Do not advertise workflow-template authoring as a Private Beta user feature; add UI E2E before exposing it |
| 5 | Multi-company / multi-project isolation | Automated | e2e `organization-portfolio.spec.ts`, `organization-portfolio-models.spec.ts`, the explicit `beta-release-matrix.spec.ts` 3×2 matrix, company/project removal tests, session/workspace scope tests, and workflow binding isolation tests | Provider credentials are intentionally desktop-profile/provider scoped for supervised Private Beta, not company/project scoped; Models UI and handoff state this limitation explicitly |
| 6 | Parallel agents | Automated | `tests/execution-coordinator.test.ts` (atomic multi-pool acquire, typed over-capacity refusal, wait/deadline, review vs execution pool independence), `tests/compute-ledger.test.ts` (concurrent reservations cannot overspend one account; crash-safe restore), `tests/beta-reliability.test.ts` ("cancels one of two isolated parallel runs without stopping the other"), `tests/task-worktree.test.ts` (independent rollbackable worktrees, dirty-workspace refusal, conflict fail-closed), benchmarks rust-parallel-runtime-v2 scale contract (1–100 sessions) | — |
| 7 | LLM providers / failure handling | Automated | `tests/provider-runtime.test.ts` (bounded retry defaults, unsafe-URL rejection), `tests/provider-ping.test.ts` (auth vs unreachable vs transport fail-closed), `tests/beta-reliability.test.ts` (502 + explicit HTTP 429/rate-limit retry classification, rollback/failover, auth/config fail-closed), `tests/runtime-notices.test.ts`, `tests/gateway-client-stability.test.ts`, `e2e/beta-multimodel.mjs` | Fresh RC execution evidence pending |
| 8 | Budget / entitlement | Automated | `tests/compute-ledger.test.ts` (reservation/settlement, included-value excluded from cash, idempotent ingest), `tests/organization-control-plane.test.ts` (daily + monthly cash limits from settled usage only; fail-closed when accounting unavailable), `tests/usage-ledger.test.ts`, `tests/token-saver.test.ts` + `tests/tool-routing.test.ts` (Shadow/Assist/Enforce, fail-open fallback) — landed with the compute-budget-correctness and token-tool-routing branches | — |
| 9 | Git safety | Automated | `GitService.push()` and `pushBranch()` now fail closed on dirty trees **and** scan the committed tree before network mutation; high-confidence secrets and sensitive credential files are blocked without logging secret values. `tests/git-service.test.ts` covers clean allow, secret block, sensitive-file block, divergence and dirty-tree refusal; `tests/task-worktree.test.ts` covers isolated worktrees. | Fresh RC execution evidence pending |
| 10 | Terminal + filesystem | Automated | `tests/terminal-manager.test.ts` (chat-bound ops, ConPTY handling, bounded scrollback, restart persistence, malformed-state tolerance), `tests/nd-core-contract.test.ts` (terminal truthfulness/reconciliation, deadlines), inline tests in `crates/nd-runtime/src/terminal.rs`, `tests/path-utils.test.ts` (traversal rejection, Windows case-insensitivity, workspace scoping), e2e `smoke.spec.ts` real PTY through sandboxed bridge | — |
| 11 | Browser tools | Partial | Existing lease/token/policy/shutdown tests plus `tests/browser-download-manager.test.ts` (direct download and agent pause/allow/deny/fail-closed lifecycle), `bench:browser-runtime` cookie/storage/download proof, explicit external-CDP loopback tests, and `e2e:companion:chrome` | Chrome `captureVisibleTab` still requires a real toolbar invocation; final Human Chrome check remains mandatory |
| 12 | MCP / skills errors | Partial | Existing runtime/router/timeout/malformed coverage plus `tests/extension-example-mcp.test.ts` now proves a broken MCP child is contained and a repaired subsequent request succeeds without restarting ND. E2E config persistence remains in `agent-capabilities-mcp-config.spec.ts`. | Full interactive-agent-session recovery after MCP child failure remains a Human RC check |
| 13 | Persistence / recovery | Automated | `tests/organization-snapshot-manager.test.ts` (restore before stores load), `tests/organization-recovery.test.ts` (last-known-good backup on corrupt snapshot; stale running work marked failed/retryable after restart), `tests/core-session-journal.test.ts` + e2e `effect-journal.spec.ts` (journal replays after full app restart), `tests/compute-ledger.test.ts` reservation restore, `tests/terminal-manager.test.ts` restart persistence | — |
| 14 | Security boundaries | Partial | Existing redaction, credential-env scrub, provider-secret preservation, approval gates, renderer/release hardening, product Git secret blocking, explicit Electron CDP bind verification, and `tests/external-inspect-failure.test.ts` rejecting non-loopback debugger sockets; packaged external-inspect MCP enforces the same loopback rule | Provider API keys are desktop-global in supervised Private Beta; verify the real OS secure-storage backend and this limitation on the RC machine |
| 15 | Failure drills (kill sidecar / no internet / provider down / merge conflict / disk full) | Partial | Automated proof covers forced nd-core descendant cleanup, provider failover/rollback, corrupt-state recovery, merge-conflict fail-closed, malformed terminal state, and 429 classification. The final evidence gate now also requires a Human `failureDrills` PASS. | On the exact RC, a tester must perform network interruption, nd-core interruption during active work, unwritable user-data path, and disposable-volume disk-pressure drills from the handoff |
| 16 | Performance | Partial | Existing startup/contract/task/runtime benchmarks plus `e2e:beta:soak` repeatedly exercises renderer interaction and samples Electron working-set/process-count growth. `beta:automated` requires browser/contract/task evidence. | A real 24-hour RC soak and human long-session judgment remain mandatory; the harness is a guardrail, not a universal leak proof |
| 17 | 24-hour soak | Partial | `e2e/beta-soak.spec.ts` + `e2e:beta:soak` keep one Electron lifetime active, switch a 3×2 portfolio, sample process working set/count, assert ownership/ID stability and write a JSON receipt. The final gate rejects soak evidence shorter than 1440 minutes. | The actual 24-hour RC run must happen on the local release machine |
| 18 | Real-user E2E (3 companies × 2 projects) | Partial | `e2e/beta-release-matrix.spec.ts` creates an explicit 3 companies × 2 projects matrix, rejects forged cross-company writes, repeats switching and proves full-restart persistence. Existing `e2e:prod:user` and multi-model tests cover live execution/parallel/provider behavior. | Human real-world matrix on the exact RC remains required |
| 19 | Observability / diagnostics export | Automated | Existing redaction/notice/evidence tests plus `e2e/qa-functional.spec.ts` now drives Settings → About → Copy diagnostics through the real UI, reads the clipboard from Electron, and asserts workspace/project identity is omitted. | Fresh RC execution evidence pending |
| 20 | Rollback one release version | Partial | `tests/dsh-package-update.test.ts` (upgrade/repair, never replaces org state by design), worktree/task-attempt rollback in `tests/beta-reliability.test.ts` + `tests/task-worktree.test.ts` | Release-level rollback (previous version + user state intact) is unproven until the update channel ships (readiness item 9) |
| 21 | Quick Launcher / global popup / external capture | Partial | `tests/quick-launcher.test.ts` (shortcut validation, bounded titles, scoped task/memory mutations, toggle-safe modes), `e2e/quick-launcher.spec.ts` (in-app + popup toggle, real persisted task/memory, cross-company project switch, no renderer errors) | Global shortcut ownership, popup focus/minimize behavior, real screen/area capture and annotation, clipboard permissions and orphan-process cleanup are Human-only checks in [quick-launcher-manual.md](../qa/quick-launcher-manual.md) |
| 22 | ND Extensions + governed native host | Partial | `tests/nd-extension-package.test.ts`, `tests/nd-extension-lifecycle.test.ts`, `tests/nd-invocation-broker.test.ts` (activation gating, deny-wins policy, grant/revocation, one-shot consumption, run-credential binding, content-free audit), `tests/wallpaper-native.test.ts`, `pnpm ext:validate --builtins`, `e2e/nd-home-extensions.spec.ts` | Operator manual P0/P1 rows in [nd-extensions-home-manual.md](../qa/nd-extensions-home-manual.md) remain unrecorded; the **agent-side native-host bridge is deferred** — no coding engine can invoke native host methods yet, so that acceptance bullet must not be claimed |
| 23 | ND Home personal workspace | Partial | `tests/nd-extension-lifecycle.test.ts` (notes/captures/chats, managed per-chat folder, corrupt-record quarantine), `tests/harness-session-scope.test.ts` (personal chats stay out of workspace listings), `e2e/nd-home-extensions.spec.ts` | Human check that Home is usable before any company exists and personal content never leaks into an active workspace |
| 24 | General / Coding workspace profiles | Partial | `tests/workspace-profile.test.ts`, `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` (product shell boots in General and can enter the Coding workspace; unsupported action refuses with clear wording) | Human judgment that the General/Coding distinction is understandable and correctly scoped on the packaged RC |

## Five highest-risk areas before inviting users

1. **State recovery** — best covered in the tree (snapshot manager, recovery tests, effect journal). Remaining risk is the packaged artifact, not the logic: close the gap via installed-app E2E (readiness item 6) and the soak (item 17).
2. **Parallel-agent isolation** — strongest area: execution coordinator, compute ledger, worktree independence, parallel cancel isolation all automated. Keep green under the current branch's token/tool-routing changes (`tests/tool-routing.test.ts`).
3. **Multi-company isolation** — automated for data/tasks/workspaces/workflows, including forged cross-company rejection and the new 3×2 restart matrix. Provider keys are deliberately documented as desktop-global for this supervised Private Beta, so one desktop is one trusted operator security domain.
4. **Git/worktree safety** — dirty/diverged/refusal behaviors plus the new committed-secret push guard are implemented; the remaining requirement is fresh RC execution and Human inspection of the resulting Git/worktree state.
5. **Credential/security boundaries** — redaction, env scrub, approval gates, write-only provider credentials, committed-secret push blocking, and loopback-only Electron CDP are enforced. True per-company/project provider-secret isolation is a later runtime/gateway boundary change and must not be claimed in this beta.

## Cross-cutting gate risks

These four appear across multiple checklist rows and are the shortest path to a P0 or unprovable gate:

- **Pre-push secret scanning** (items 9, 14) — implemented on this beta-hardening branch at the real Git push boundary; fresh local RC execution is still required.
- **Provider credential scope** (items 5, 14) — Private Beta explicitly treats provider API keys as **desktop-global operator resources**, not company/project secrets. Do not use one ND desktop for mutually untrusted tenants. True company/project/env secret isolation requires a shared-Harness/gateway runtime-boundary change and remains a later release-hardening item.
- **CI parked as `.github-bk/`** — all of the above evidence is locally attested, not runner-attested; restoring CI is readiness item 1 and gates item 1 (fresh install/upgrade) via blocked-0004.
- **Release-level rollback + update channel** (item 20, readiness items 8–9) — unsigned binaries and no staged update verification are the hard stop for distribution beyond hand-delivered copies.
