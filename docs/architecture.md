# ND-DSH architecture

ND-DSH is the product and control plane. Model vendors and coding runtimes are replaceable execution dependencies.

## Ownership

| Subsystem | Product owner | Runtime implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| companies, projects, goals, tasks | ND-DSH | `OrganizationStore` + orchestrator |
| teams, roles, AI employees | ND-DSH | organization domain |
| skills and memory | ND-DSH | compiled into runtime context/tools |
| company policy | ND-DSH | orchestrator + main-process approval gate |
| model-provider routes | ND-DSH | provider compiler → Harness LLM adapters |
| coding-engine routes | ND-DSH | engine registry + per-employee assignments |
| task workspace / checkpoint provenance | ND-DSH | TaskWorktreeManager + organization run ledger |
| runtime permits / parallel capacity | ND-DSH | ExecutionCoordinator + nd-core scheduler |
| primary coding runtime | ND-DSH adapter | DeepSeek Harness (tracks upstream latest) |
| delegated Codex execution | ND-DSH adapter | pinned Harness Codex provider → official Codex app-server |
| visible embedded browser | ND-DSH / Electron | one `WebContentsView` + exact CDP target |
| existing-profile browser companion | ND-DSH integration | MV3 extension + Native Messaging + `nd-browser-host` |
| browser automation | ND-DSH integration | embedded agent-browser path + companion semantic driver through the extension router |
| desktop lifecycle / IPC | ND-DSH | Electron main + context-isolated preload |
| product UI | ND-DSH | React renderer |

The source may contain upstream package names where they are technically required, but product-domain state and user-facing identity must not depend on one model vendor or coding engine.

```

The hidden Harness web surface remains compatibility/debug infrastructure. ND-DSH forces the normal product surface to the ND workbench and does not present the upstream UI as product identity.

## Control-plane state

ND keeps durable product state outside runtime-vendor configuration:

- `organization.json` — companies, projects, workforce, workflows, tasks, policies, memory, activity, run receipts, coordination events, task workspace/checkpoint provenance, integration state.
- `organization.json.bak` — last-known-good organization recovery copy.
- `providers.json` — provider metadata only; no API keys.
- `provider-secrets.json` — OS-backed encrypted provider credentials where secure storage is available.
- `engine-assignments.json` — per-AI-employee coding-engine routes; absence means `nd-harness`.
- Harness session storage — durable execution transcripts owned by the runtime adapter.

Organization state uses validated snapshots, serialized/atomic writes, backup recovery, and startup reconciliation for interrupted runs. Engine assignments use atomic writes and fail back to the primary ND Harness route if the assignment file is unreadable.

Provider credentials are write-only from the renderer's point of view. `ProviderStore.list()` returns `apiKey: ''` plus a `hasApiKey` flag; replacement and clearing use dedicated validated IPC calls. The decrypted value stays in the trusted main process and only enters the ephemeral environment inherited by the model-runtime child.

## Model providers are not coding engines

A **provider** supplies a model endpoint. A **coding engine** supplies an agent/execution environment.

```text
AI employee
   |
   +-- model route --------> DeepSeek / OpenAI-style / Anthropic-style / catalog / gateway
   |
   `-- coding engine ------> ND Harness / Codex CLI / future engine
```

`src/main/provider-runtime.ts` compiles enabled ND provider settings into provider+model routes. DeepSeek remains a seeded compatibility route; the company/task domain does not depend on it.

`src/main/engines/` owns the coding-engine registry and employee assignments. ND currently supports the primary Harness plus direct workspace-capable adapters including Codex, ZCode, Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity and Pi, with additional installed CLI adapters such as OpenCode, Goose, JCode and Hermes. Delegated Codex remains a fallback. Vendor authentication/model/tool policy stays native; the organization domain never requires vendor-specific task fields.

## AI company execution

```text
objective
  -> AI PM plan
  -> goal / milestones / dependency-aware tasks
  -> safe ready tasks dispatched in parallel
  -> task lease + dedicated worktree + engine session
  -> checkpoint exact output
  -> ND machine/artifact verification
  -> independent reviewer
  -> integration queue
     pass: integrate + memory + unlock dependency
     conflict/fail: preserve task branch + explicit rework/block
  -> next safe work
```

Global planning runs remain serialized where they mutate shared planning truth, but isolated task execution/review runs may run concurrently across projects/companies when leases, dependency/scope checks, policies and runtime pools allow it. Each independent writable task has its own transaction/worktree boundary. Cancellation never counts as completion, and a desktop restart converts stale running receipts to explicit interrupted failures so work can recover from a known task boundary.

## Approval and policy boundary

Organization-level plan/execute/review policy is checked before a run starts. Runtime permission escalations are also intercepted in the main process before they reach React.

For an approval-bearing organization run:

1. ND associates the session with its organization run.
2. A conservative classifier maps high-confidence requests to existing company actions such as `external.publish`, `production.deploy`, `money.spend`, or `data.destructive`.
3. `DENY` is rejected in the main process.
4. `ALLOW` is resolved as allow-once.
5. `ASK`, unknown requests, classification uncertainty, or gate errors remain human-visible.

The pinned Harness approval wire exposes tool name and reason, not arbitrary tool arguments. ND therefore does **not** claim perfect semantic enforcement for every possible command. Non-approval-bearing browser/MCP/external actions still need normalized action metadata before enterprise GA.

## Browser-target invariants

For the **embedded ND browser**, the browser visible to the user is the browser
controlled by the agent. ND asks the embedded view's debugger for its exact CDP
`targetId`, then binds agent-browser to that target. The CLI and MCP integration
share the same generated agent-browser config/session so an agent cannot silently
create a second hidden browser.

The product browser starts at `about:blank`; localhost development pages are
opened only when explicitly requested.

The **Browser Companion** is a separate, explicit target for an existing
Chrome/Chromium profile. It does not weaken or replace the embedded same-browser
invariant. A user installs the MV3 extension, registers the Native Messaging host,
and grants per-origin site access. The extension controls the selected real tab
inside that profile through a semantic content driver; no hidden automation
browser is launched.

The companion's Rust host is transport-only. Electron main owns connection state
and one-writer tab leases, while engine access reuses the universal extension
router. Page content is untrusted application data. Password values and cookies
are not exported. Company-level normalized browser action policy remains required
before enterprise policy-completeness claims.

## Renderer trust boundary

- Node integration: off.
- Context isolation: on.
- Renderer sandbox: on.
- Web security: on.
- Main-process IPC: trusted main frame only with bounded inputs.
- Browser permissions: denied by default.
- External URLs: HTTP/HTTPS only.
- Workspace reads: root-contained with realpath/symlink protections.
- Existing provider credentials: never returned to React; only existence/replacement/clear operations are exposed.

If the trusted preload or organization bridge is unavailable, the renderer fails closed with a runtime-unavailable screen. It does not create demo companies, fake sessions, mock workspaces, or localStorage product state.

## Coding-engine capability posture

ND advertises only capabilities it actually wires.

### ND Harness

- durable sessions and streaming
- filesystem and shell
- visible browser
- ND skills and MCP
- provider-neutral model routing
- human approvals/questions

### Workspace-capable direct engines

Codex CLI, ZCode CLI, Claude Code CLI, Cursor CLI, Antigravity CLI and Pi CLI use the common direct-engine session contract when installed. OpenCode, Goose, JCode and Hermes are additional registered CLI adapters. ND binds organization sessions to the task workspace selected by the control plane; a direct adapter cannot silently re-root that session to another checkout.

### Delegated Codex fallback

Delegated Codex remains a one-shot Harness-backed route. ND does not claim browser/MCP/skill or persistent-thread capabilities that the delegated route does not provide. Native engine authentication, provider/model and project configuration remain authoritative.

## Failure behavior

- Missing/unbuilt Harness: engine is unavailable and a run is rejected before a false run receipt is created.
- Missing/unbuilt Codex adapter: employees cannot be newly assigned to Codex and existing Codex-routed work is rejected before starting.
- Codex auth/trust failure: task remains a visible failure/blocker; ND does not invent completion.
- Missing provider credential: the active route reports its real model error; provider metadata never substitutes a fake result.
- Secure credential store unavailable: key remains memory-only instead of being persisted insecurely.
- Embedded browser bridge unavailable: the visible embedded browser remains manual; agent-browser reports unavailable.
- Browser Companion unavailable or disconnected: the embedded browser remains usable and companion calls fail closed rather than blocking desktop startup.
- Approval policy gate failure: request falls back to human `ASK`, never implicit allow.
- App restart mid-run: stale organization run is reconciled as interrupted/failed.

## Public-beta release gates

Passing source CI is necessary but not sufficient for a public desktop release. Before publishing installers, ND still needs:

- packaged/bundled Node-compatible Harness and agent-browser runtime assets
- macOS signing/notarization and Windows signing
- installed-app E2E on supported platforms
- Codex authentication/health onboarding UX
- normalized action metadata for policy enforcement beyond Harness approval frames
- update/release provenance, SBOM/notices, and crash provenance policy

These are release engineering and policy-completeness gates, not mock functionality; the product runtime used by the desktop is real.
